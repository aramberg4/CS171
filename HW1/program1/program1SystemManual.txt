Program: program1.cpp

- This program projects the cost of a college education for high school students who are looking for a college given the student's initial tuition and percentage of yearly tution increase. 

- This program calculates the tuiton for each year recursively using the formula below:

	t' = (1+r)t = Rt
	Where:
	t = the previous year
	t' = the current year
	r = the percentage of yearly tution increase
	R = r + 1

- The program accepts an initial tuition value in dollars but then converts to pennies to make calcualtions easier.
The final answers are then converted by to dollars using integer division and modulo.
	dollars = t/penniesPerDollar;
    cents = float (t % penniesPerDollar) / float(penniesPerDollar);
    T = dollars + cents;

    Where:
    penniesPerDollar = 100
    t = tuition (in pennies)
    T = t converted back to dollars

- The code below is used to make sure cents are formatted correctly in the output stream of the final answers:

	cout.setf(ios::fixed);
    cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
    cout.precision(2);
