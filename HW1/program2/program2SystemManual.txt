Program: program2.cpp

- This program asks the	user to input a number of fluid ounces. It then allocates the fluid ounces into the various units, first starting with barrels, then gallons, and soon, finishing with tablespoons.

- The program makes use of the following conversion rates to make these calculations:
	
	1	fluid ounce	=	2	tablespoons
	1	gill		=	4	fluid ounces (fl oz)
	1	cup			=	2	gills
	1	pint		=	2	cups
	1	quart		=	2	pints
	1	gallon		=	4	quarts
	1	barrel		=	42	gallons

- Integer division and the conversion rates above are used to calculate the integer amount of each unit that can be yielded by the amount of ounces.

	int pints = ouncesLeft / (cupsPerPint * gillsPerCup * ouncesPerGill);

	Will return the amount of whole pints given a certain number of ounces.

- Modulo is used to find the remainder of ounces that couldn't evenly divide into a unit to be used on the next unit of measurement. 

	ouncesLeft = ouncesLeft % (cupsPerPint * gillsPerCup * ouncesPerGill);

	Will return the  number of ounces that remain after the pints have been "filled."

- This process is repeated from barrels down to tablespoons until the number of ounces is exhausted.
