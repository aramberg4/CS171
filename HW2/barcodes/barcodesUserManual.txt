Program: barcodes.cpp

- This program asks the user to enter a valid zipcode and then converts it to a barcode.

- The program assumes the user will enter a valid zipcode.

- The program will check that the zipcode is nonnegative and output an error message if it is negative.

- To run the program, you must compile it and then execute it using programs such as VisualStudio, Xcode, or a command line interface.

- Once you have compiled and executed the program, it will prompt you to enter a five digit barcode. Enter in a valid, nonnegative zipcode (e.x. 95014).

- Once you hit the final return, the program will output the converted barcode.
